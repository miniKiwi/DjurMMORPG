<b id="interactions">INTERACTIONS / BEHAVIOUR</b><br>
The spotted hyaena is one the most highly gregarious of all carnivores; it lives in groups containing up to 90 individuals, and exhibits the most complex social behaviour.<br>
 The society is characterised by a strict dominance hierarchy. <br>
 Females are dominant over males, and even the lowest ranking female is dominant to the highest ranking male. <br>
  Although males typically disperse from their natal clans when they are between two and six years of age (Smale et al 1997; Boydston et al. 2005), females usually remain in their natal clan, so large clans may contain several different matrilines.<br>
  Although cubs of both sexes 'inherit' their mothers' social ranks, males voluntarily forsake those to assume much lower ranks in the neighboring cans to which they disperse. <br>
  Spotted hyaenas live in a "fission-fusion" society, so clan members do not remain together continuously, but instead frequently forage alone or in small groups.<br>
  <br>
Clan Size: Unlike many other social species where all group members are usually seen together, spotted hyaena clan members frequently wander alone or in small groups and only sometimes meet in large numbers. This occurs at kills, at the communal den, or when clan members rally together to defend individual carcasses or group territories <br>
 Territory size in the spotted hyaena is highly variable, ranging from less than 40 km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000 km2 in the Kalahari.<br>
 Clans defend communal territories through <b>vocal displays</b>, <b>scent marking</b> and <b>boundary patrols</b>.<br>
 Clan members also cooperate in defending territories during boundary disputes with neighbouring clans. Long distance calls, particularly whoops, are used to quickly rally clan members to such sites of conflict. Spotted hyaenas scent mark their territories by pasting a secretion from the anal gland onto grass stalks, and by depositing a secretion from interdigital glands when they scratch the ground. Spotted hyaenas also scent mark their territories by defecating in communal latrines. Pasting sites and communal latrines are normally scattered throughout a clan's territory and this "hinterland" scent marking strategy may be a way of optimising the distribution of scent marks over a large area with a limited amount of scent and time.<br>
 The spotted hyaena has a ritualised greeting or meeting ceremony during which two individuals stand parallel and face in opposite directions. Both individuals usually lift the hind leg nearest to the other and sniff or lick the anogenital region of the other.<br>
 <b>Scent marking:</b> Scent glands, situated on either side of the rectum, discharge secretions into a sac situated between the tail and the anus. During scent marking the sac is everted and the secretions are deposited by the hyaena from a semi-crouched position while walking or standing over a grass stalk or small bush.
 <br>
 NON-RESIDENT VISITORS<br>
 In the Serengeti, clans defend territories against neighbouring clans but individual animals may move in transit through other clan territories when they commute to distant migratory herds (Hofer and East 1993b). When migratory herds are present inside a clan territory, many non-residents also enter the territory to feed. Non-residents typically signal submission and retreat when detecting residents, and at kills non-residents usually wait at a distance and feed after residents have departed. Aggression between residents and non-residents is rare when commuters are in transit. Aggression is more common when residents encounter intruders searching for food, and most intense at kills where agonistic encounters may escalate into fights causing serious damage (Hofer and East 1993b). The commuting system of Serengeti hyaenas and the flexible response of territory owners to intruders illustrate the flexible nature of the social behaviour of spotted hyaenas (see also Knight et al. 1992).
	<br>
	The spotted hyaena detects live prey by sight, hearing, and smell. It detects carrion by smell, the noise of other predators feeding on the carcass, or during daytime, by watching vultures descending on a carcass. Its hearing is acute enough to pick up noises emanating from predators killing prey or feeding on carcasses over distances of up to 10 km<br>
	The spotted hyaena travels long distances in search of prey. In the Kalahari, the <b>average distance travelled</b> between significant food items varied between 42 and 80 km.<br>
	In Chobe hyaenas walked up to 28 km between a clan range and a permanent source of water.<br>
	<br>
<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
Spotted Hyenas usually give birth to two young, sometimes three.<br>
110d Gestation. Unique among carnivorous mammals, spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6–7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors.<br>In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels – the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione – are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology.[66] This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males.[67] The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported.[60] Males take no part in the raising of young.<br>
?		Cubs will attack each other shortly after birth. Spotted Hyena cubs can go for several days between feeds. <br>
10d		Within ten days of birth, they are able to move at considerable speed.<br>
4-6w	L Remain hidden until mobile<br>
2-3m	Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2–3 months.
3m		They can process solid food<br>
8m		They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months<br>
12-16m	Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12–16 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months.will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year.<br>
2y		Young males leave<br>
3y		Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years<br>
4y		L Most females have first litter around age 4, Most males leave the pride by the age of 4.<br>
6y		L Stops growing.<br>
11y 	L Female reproduction begins to decline.<br>
12-13y	L Males live 12-13 years in the wild. (20-25 years in captivity)<br>
15y 	L Females stop breeding.<br>
12-25y	The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years, with a maximum of 25 years<br>
<br>
The structure of dens does not normally permit the access of adult animals, so cubs must emerge at the den entrance to have contact with their mother.<br>
The social life of a clan is centered around the communal den. Some clans use particular den sites for years whereas others may use several different dens within a year or even several den sites simultaneously. These may be separated by up to 7 km (Hofer and East 1993a). The dens are not excavated by hyaenas. Instead, dens have usually been abandoned by other species, mostly warthog, aardvark and bat-eared fox (Kruuk 1972a). 
<br>

	<br>
<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
They are very vocal animals with over 11 different calls recorded and they emit sounds that are too quiet for the human ear to detect. <br>
Their calls include <br>
Whoops - to rally the group or locate cubs, <br>
Soft squeals - when greeting another member of the group,<br>
"Laugh" - emitted in fear or to show submission to a senior clan member.<br>
Here you will hear the hyenas giggling (expressing nervousness) and whooping (calling in more recruits to help deal with the lions) and lowing. Lowing appears to be a vocalization that functions to bring all hyenas present to the same state of arousal in order for them to engage in a coordinated attack on the lions. Notice that the vocalizations stop as soon as the hyenas displace the lions from thir kill.<br>
The best known spotted hyaena vocalisation is the whoop, which can be heard over several kilometres. Spotted hyaenas can recognise each other individually by their whoops, at least within their clan. Mothers whoop to locate their wandering cubs and some animals whoop to recruit hunting partners.  Adult males whoop more frequently than females, and top-ranking males put more effort into vocal displays than lower ranking males. <br>
Another well-known vocalisation is the laugh or giggle, which is a signal of submission. A submissive individual giggles to signal to its partner that it accepts a lower status.<br>

<b id="diet">Diet</b><br>
The spotted hyena is the most carnivorous member of the Hyaenidae.[14] It has been subjected to one of the most widespread misconceptions of being a scavenger, when it is in fact a proficient predator. <br>
The spotted hyena is very efficient at eating its prey; not only is it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, and are more likely to stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.[86]<br>
PREFERED PREY <b>Wildebeest</b> are the most commonly taken medium sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with <b>zebra</b> and <b>Thomson's gazelles</b> coming close behind.[87] Cape buffalo are rarely attacked due to differences in habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion.<br>
AMOUNT A single spotted hyena can eat at least 14.5 kg of meat per meal<br>
FIGHTING Although spotted hyenas act aggressively toward each other when feeding, they compete with each other mostly through speed of eating, rather than by fighting as lions do.<br>
STYLE When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace.<br>
 Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow.<br>
 SPEED of EATING A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn,[96] while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes<br>
 WATER Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.<br>
 <br>
 A Spotted Hyena will steal kills from cheetahs and leopards, but not lions.<br>
 Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1.<br>
 Spotted hyenas usually keep a safe distance from Nile crocodiles. Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, hyenas will avoid crocodile infested waters.<br>
 The spotted hyaena primarily kills and scavenges mammalian herbivores. These include small, medium and large-sized antelope, Cape buffalo, and other herbivores such as zebra, warthog, and the young of giraffe, hippopotamus and rhinoceros. It can be very opportunistic and has been recorded eating almost any mammal, bird, fish or reptile, irrespective of size or species<br>
  It may also pick up carrion and human-associated organic material, including cooked porridge, offal, garbage, a variety of vegetable matter, and buffalo and wildebeest dung.<br>
