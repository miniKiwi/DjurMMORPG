 Falbkatten förekommer i hela Afrika med undantag av ökenområden och tropiska regnskogar<br>
Geparden är ett typiskt djur för savannen. Den föredrar regioner med högt gräs, som kan dölja den för bytesdjur, och kullar, som tjänstgör som utsiktspunkter. I områden med många träd och buskar har geparden svårt att uppnå tillräcklig hastighet under jakten.<br>
The cheetah is generally considered to be an animal of open country and grass lands. This impression is probably due to the ease of sighting the cheetah in the shorter grass. However, cheetahs use a wider variety of habitats, and are found often in dense vegetation and even mountainous terrain.<br>
<br>
<b id="colors">COLORS</b><br>
Colour mutations?<br>
KING CHEETAH - Caused by one recessive gene.<br>
Other rare color morphs of the species include speckles, melanism, albinism and gray coloration. Most have been reported in Indian cheetahs, particularly in captive specimens kept for hunting.<br>
In a letter to "Nature in East Africa", H. F. Stoneham reported a melanistic cheetah (black with ghost markings) in the Trans-Nzoia District of Kenya in 1925. Vesey Fitzgerald saw a melanistic cheetah in Zambia in the company of a spotted cheetah. Red (erythristic) cheetahs have dark tawny spots on a golden background. Cream (isabelline) cheetahs have pale red spots on a pale background. Some desert region cheetahs are unusually pale; probably they are better-camouflaged and therefore better hunters and more likely to breed and pass on their paler coloration. Blue (Maltese or grey) cheetahs have variously been described as white cheetahs with grey-blue spots (chinchilla) or pale grey cheetahs with darker grey spots (Maltese mutation). A cheetah with hardly any spots was shot in Tanzania in 1921 (Pocock); it had only a few spots on the neck and back, and these were unusually small. Another cheetah with this color-morph was photgraphed in Kenya in 2012<br>
<br>
The cheetah's chest is deep and its waist is narrow. The coarse, short fur of the cheetah is tan with round black spots measuring from 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.2 in) across, affording it some camouflage while hunting. There are no spots on its white underside, but the tail has spots, which merge to form four to six dark rings at the end. The tail usually ends in a bushy white tuft. The cheetah has a small head with high-set eyes. Black "tear marks" running from the corner of its eyes down the sides of the nose to its mouth keep sunlight out of its eyes and aid in hunting and seeing long distances. Its thin and fragile body make it well-suited to short bursts of high speed, but not to long-distance running.<br><br>

	<b id="interactions">INTERACTIONS / BEHAVIOUR</b><br>
<br>
 While running, in addition to having good traction due to its semi-retractable claws, the cheetah uses its tail as a rudder-like means of steering to allow it to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank prey animals that often make such turns to escape.<br>
 Unlike true big cats of subfamily Pantherinae, the cheetah can purr as it inhales, but cannot roar.<br>
 Unlike males, females are solitary and tend to avoid each other, though some mother/daughter pairs have been known to be formed for small periods of time. The cheetah has a unique, well-structured social order. Females live alone, except when they are raising cubs and they raise their cubs on their own.<br>
 Males<br>
Males are often social and may group together for life, usually with their brothers in the same litter; although if a cub is the only male in the litter then two or three lone males may form a group, or a lone male may join an existing group. These groups are called <i>coalitions</i>. I sällsynta fall förekommer grupper med upp till 15 individer. Usually 2 to 5 individuals.<br><br>
A coalition is six times more likely to obtain an animal territory than a lone male, although studies have shown that coalitions keep their territories just as long as lone males— between four to four and a half years.<br>
Males are territorial. Females' home ranges can be very large and a territory including several females' ranges is impossible to defend. Instead, males choose the points at which several of the females' home ranges overlap, creating a much smaller space, which can be properly defended against intruders while maximizing the chance of reproduction. Coalitions will try their best to maintain territories to find females with whom they will mate. The size of the territory also depends on the available resources; depending on the part of Africa, the size of a male's territory can vary greatly from 37 to 160 km2 (14 to 62 sq mi).<br>
Males will attempt to kill any intruders, and fights result in serious injury or death.<br>
Males mark their territory by urinating on objects that stand out, such as trees, logs, or termite mounds. When male cheetahs urine-mark their territories, they stand one meter away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised<br>
The whole coalition contributes to the scent.<br>
Territories are often located in areas where there is a rich supply of wild game and/or water. <br>
Females<br>
Unlike males and other felines, females do not establish territories. Instead, the area they live in is termed a home range. These overlap with other females' home ranges, often those of their daughters, mothers, or sisters. Females always hunt alone, although cubs will accompany their mothers to learn to hunt once they reach the age of five to six weeks.<br>
The size of a home range depends entirely on the availability of prey. Cheetahs in southern African woodlands have ranges as small as 34 km2 (13 sq mi), while in some parts of Namibia they can reach 1,500 km2 (580 sq mi).<br>
<br>
Despite their speed and hunting prowess, cheetahs are largely outranked by other large predators in most of their range. Because they have evolved for short bursts of extreme speed at the expense of their power, they cannot defend themselves against most of Africa's other predator species. They usually avoid fighting and will surrender a kill immediately to even a single hyena, rather than risk injury. Because cheetahs rely on their speed to obtain their meals, any injury that slows them down could essentially be life threatening.<br>
För att hitta antiloper klättrar geparden ofta på träd eller termitstackar<br>
Cheetahs do not make good fighters. They prefer to run from threat and are non−aggressive by nature.<br>
<br>
The cheetah is aerodynamically built for speed and can accelerate from zero to 40 mph in three strides and to full speed of 70 mph in seconds. As the cheetah runs, only one foot at a time touches the ground. There are two points, in its 20 to 25 foot stride when no feet touch the ground, as they are fully extended and then totally doubled up. Nearing full speed, the cheetah is running at about 3½ strides per second. The cheetah’s respiratory rate climbs from 60 to 150 breaths per minute during a high-speed chase and can run only 400 to 600 yards before it is exhausted; at this time it is extremely vulnerable to other predators, which may not only steal its prey, but attack it as well. <br>
Covering 7-8 meters in a stride, with only one foot touching the ground at a time, the cheetah can reach a speed of 110 km/h in seconds. At two points in the stride, no feet touch the ground.<br>
<br>
Since cheetahs rely on sight for hunting, they are diurnal: more active in the day than night. In warm weather, they move around mostly during the early morning and late in the afternoon when the temperatures are cooler.<br>
<br><br>
VISION - A cheetah's field of vision is far greater than that of humans (210 degrees versus 140). <br>
Cheetahs cannot see as well as other cats at night.<br>
They have excellent vision for distant objects and may even see some colours. <br>
Cheetahs can see detail to a distance of 5 km, while humans with binoculars would have difficulty seeing the same detail. <br>
Although they rely primarily on sight, cheetahs have excellent hearing. They are able to hear the slightest sound and high frequencies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b id="diet">Diet</b><br>
Geparden är det nu levande snabbaste däggdjuret och kan korta sträckor springa i upp till 114 km/h. The cheetah is only able to maintain its maximum speed for roughly 275 meters. <br>
<b>PREFERRED FOOD</b>  The cheetah is a carnivore, eating mostly <b>mammals under 40 kg</b> (88 lb), including the Thomson's gazelle, the Grant's gazelle, the springbok and the impala. The young of larger mammals such as wildebeests and zebras are taken at times, and adults too, when cheetahs hunt in groups. Guineafowl and hares are also prey. Vanligen är bytet inte tyngre än 60 kg.<br>
<b>AMOUNT</b> A cheetah may eat up to 14 kg of meat at one sitting and then not kill for 2-5 days. Wild cheetahs kill only for food (when hungry), and this happens every 3 days or so.<br>
FIGHTING  ?<br>
<b>HUNTING STYLE</b> While the other big cats often hunt by night, the cheetah is a diurnal hunter. It hunts usually either early in the morning or later in the evening when it is not so hot, but there is still enough light. The cheetah hunts by vision rather than by scent. Prey is stalked to within 10–30 m (33–98 ft), then chased. This is usually over in less than a minute, and if the cheetah fails to make a catch quickly, it will give up. The cheetah has an average hunting success rate of around 50%. Running at very high speeds puts a great deal of strain on the cheetah's body. When sprinting, the cheetah's body temperature quickly elevates. If it is a hard chase, it sometimes needs to rest for half an hour or more. The cheetah kills its prey by tripping it during the chase, then biting it on the underside of the throat to suffocate it; the cheetah is not strong enough to break the necks of most prey. The bite may also puncture a vital artery in the neck. Then the cheetah proceeds to devour its catch as quickly as possible before the kill is taken by stronger predators. The diet of a cheetah is dependent upon the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle. This small antelope is smaller and slower than the cheetah, which makes it an appropriate prey. Cheetahs look for individuals which have strayed some distance from their group, and do not necessarily seek out old or weak ones. A cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and by eating immediately after the kill. Geparden kastar omkull bytet genom att springa mot extremiteterna. Sedan kvävs bytet med hjälp av tänderna som sätts i bytets strupe.[4] Vanligen vilar geparden efteråt en stund men den kan inte vänta för länge om den inte vill förlora antilopen till andra rovdjur.<br><br>
 SPEED of EATING ?<br>
 WATER cheetahs have been known to swim if they need to do so. Cheetahs drink water from waterholes, rivers, or any place where water is available. However, they do not need to drink water daily. When they eat, they get fluids from their prey's organs. So, they hydrate from a combination of organ meat and water.<br>
STEAL ?<br> 
<br>


<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
<!-- Monogamous?<br> -->  A study of cheetahs in the Serengeti showed females are sexually promiscuous and often have cubs by many different males.<br>
Females are polyestrous.<br>
<b>Season:</b> Female cheetahs are polyoestrous, which means there is no regular breeding season.. May breed again when young are 18 months old.  If cubs are lost to predators, females soon come into oestrus again. <br>
<b>Oestrus:</b> average oestrus cycle of twelve days.<br>
<b>Courtship:</b> <br>

<b>Construction:</b> Who builds? How long does it take?<br>
<b>Boplats:</b> She will find a quiet, hidden spot in the tall grass, under a low tree, in thick underbrush, or in a clump of rock.<br>

90-98d Gestation.<br>
Cubs are born blind and can crawl but not walk at birth. Cubs weigh from 150 to 300 g (5.3 to 11 oz) at birth. Unlike some other cats, the cheetah is born with its characteristic spots. Cubs are also born with a downy underlying fur on their necks, called a mantle, extending to mid-back.<br>
Cheetah mothers move their cubs to a new location each day to prevent them from being killed by other predators. <br> 
10-14d Eyes open <br>
16d	Starts to walk around<br>
20d First teeth showing<br>
6m  The cubs begin to follow their mother at 6 weeks old, and begin to eat meat from her kills. From this time onward, mother and cubs remain inseparable until weaning age.<br>
2m At the age of 8 weeks they are eating meat and accompany their mother away from the den site.<br>
3m From the age of 3 months cubs practise hunting (unsuccessfully) and their mother brings small live prey to help them hone their hunting skills.
4m Neck fluff gone<br>

<!-- 3m by three months old are able to join their mother when hunting.<br> -->
<!-- 5-6m They stay with their mother for five to six months.<br> -->
18m The first eighteen months of a cub's life are important; cubs must learn many lessons, because survival depends on knowing how to hunt wild prey species and avoid other predators.<br>
16-18m At eighteen months, the mother leaves the cubs, who then form a sibling ("sib") group that will stay together for another six months.<br>
20-24(-36)m Females reach maturity in twenty to twenty-four months. At this time they leave their group.<br>
12m(30-36?) and males around twelve months (although they do not usually mate until at least three years old)<br>
2y At about two years, the female siblings leave the group, and the young males remain together for life.<br>
<!-- 1y The kittens are fully grown at one year old, and the females are able to breed at this age.<br> -->
<br>
The cheetah's mortality is very high during the early weeks of its life; up to 90% of cheetah cubs are killed during this time by lions, leopards, hyenas, wild dogs, or even by eagles. Cheetah cubs often hide in thick brush for safety. Mother cheetahs will defend their young and are at times successful in driving predators away from their cubs. Coalitions of male cheetahs can also chase away other predators, depending on the coalition size and the size and number of the predator. Because of its speed, a healthy adult cheetah has few enemies.
<br>
<br>

<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
The cheetah cannot roar, but ranks among the more vocal felids. Several sources refer to a wide variety of cheetah vocalizations, but most of these lack a detailed acoustic description which makes it difficult to reliably assess exactly what terms refer to exactly what vocalizations. A short review of the terminology encountered is found in. Some of the vocalizations listed in the literature are:

  <br>  <b>Chirping:</b> When a cheetah attempts to find another, or a mother tries to locate her cubs, it uses a high-pitched barking called chirping. The chirps made by a cheetah cub sound more like a bird chirping, and so are termed chirping, too.
 <br>   <b>Churring or stuttering:</b> This vocalization is emitted by a cheetah during social meetings. A churr can be seen as a social invitation to other cheetahs, an expression of interest, uncertainty, or appeasement or during meetings with the opposite sex (although each sex churrs for different reasons).
 <br>   <b>Growling:</b> This vocalization is often accompanied by hissing and spitting and is exhibited by the cheetah during annoyance, or when faced with danger.
 <br>   <b>Yowling:</b> This is an escalated version of growling, usually displayed when danger worsens.
 <br>   <b>Agonistic vocalizations:</b> a combination of growls, moans, hisses and the "trademark" cheetah spit, which is most often accompanied by a forceful "paw hit" on the ground.
  <br>  <b>Purring:</b> This is made when the cheetah is content, usually during pleasant social meetings (mostly between cubs and their mothers). A characteristic of purring is that it is realized on both egressive and ingressive airstream, as seen and heard on online video and audio.
	<br>
	 	Cheetahs have many unusual vocalizations. These are some of the most common calls made by cheetahs.

Purr - As with domestic cats this sound indicates a friendly and contented mood.
Chirp - A high-pitched bird-like chirp is used by a mother calling her cubs, cheetahs greeting each other and during courtship. These calls can be heard over a long distance. The intensity of the chirp increases with excitement.
Stutter Call - A male on the trail of a female in heat will use this call. It is also used by a mother asking her cubs to follow closely.
Growling, Hissing - These sounds are associated with defence and aggression. With these vocalizations, they may lunge and slap the ground, alternately crouching and growling.
Bleating - This sound expresses distress and is similar to meowing. Ihn-Ihn - This call is used by a mother to summon her young and alternates with chirping. 
	<br>

	<br>
<b id="ill">SICKNESSES, DISEASES AND COMMON INJURIES</b><br>
	Predator attacks<br>
<br>
Cheetahs live mainly in grassland savannahs. They prefer habitat which includes some cover in the form of bushes, medium-length grass, trees and small hills. However, in Namibia, this habitat is densely encroached by thornbush due to overgrazing. When cheetahs chase their prey at high speeds, they ocassionally run into this invasive thornbush, resulting in eye damage.<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes screen to become dim/whiteish. (On the blind eye(s) side) <i>OBS: Eventuellt att detta ?effecten av gr?tarr, och "vanlig" blind ger en svart effect p?k?en ist?et..?</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>Deaf (One or both ears)</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually born with. (Might increase with age.)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Speakers stop playing sound.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Broken leg</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From battle/hunting, <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (Will heal over time, but can cause death. It also may not heal very well.) Greatly decreases speed (limping animation), and agility. Maybe slight decrease to strenght. Also needs more rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open wound</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> battle/hunting <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (chance to cause infection)  More need to rest. Less agility.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Infection</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually caused by open wound. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Even more need to rest. Health going slowly down.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Poison</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Caused by eating poisonous food, or maybe old food. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Health going down, more need to rest, might roll around or show pain.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Disease</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Randomly, or by eating old or unfresh/clean food. Kan smitta. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From eating old food, small chance from eating fresh kill. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>SCARS</b><br>
	Wounds and other injuries may give scars, visible on the animal. Blind eyes will also be visible (whiteish). Also ripped/teared ears etc.

<b id="interbreed">INTERBREEDING</b> <a href="#top">^ up ^</a><br>
The African Wildcat can breed with the Domestic Cat, European Wildcat(?), Serval(?)<br>
Interbreeding is possible as they are so closely related to domestic cats. Pure genetic African Wild Cats are quite rare and only found in remote areas as elsewhere interbreeding with domestic cats has taken place.
