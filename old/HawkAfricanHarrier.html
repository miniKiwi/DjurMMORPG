<b id="colors">COLORS</b><br>
Any color morphs?<br>
The upperparts, head and breast are pale grey. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The broad wings are pale grey with a black trailing edge fringed with a narrow white line. The tail is black with a single broad white band. There is a bare facial patch of variable colour, usually red or yellow. Genders are similar, but young birds have pale brown instead of grey, and dark brown replacing black. An unusual trait of this species is the double-jointed knees it possesses, which enable it to reach into otherwise inaccessible holes and cracks for prey. A comparable leg-structure and behavior can be found in the Neotropical Crane Hawk.<br>
The colour is mainly a dark grey, with round black spots on the scapulars and smaller ones on the upper wings. It has fine barring of black and white on the chest. The tail is black with a broad white stripe across the middle and a small white tip. The facial skin is bare, and the legs are also bare, and the colour normally yellow.<br>

Then a troop of baboons came along the cliffs above the nest, rolling down rocks and making a ruckus. The bird sat still on the nest in an upright position, with the facial skin pale yellow all the time the baboons were near. When the baboons moved off, the bird relaxed and the skin turned pink. Eventually, when all was quiet and the Gymnogene was about to fall asleep, the skin turned deep red!
I have never observed the courtship behaviour of these birds, but according to the literature the bird’s face also flushes red during mating.<br>This is a large hawk with extensive bare facial parts which change colour from yellow to a deep crimson shade. <br><br>

They feed mainly on young birds taken from nests, rodents, snakes, bats, birds’ eggs, fish and frogs. They nest in tall trees or on cliffs, the nest being a large platform of sticks built by the birds themselves.

FLIGHT STYLE Gymnogene soars easily and steadily. In flight, it appears very buoyant, with its broad and rounded wings. Usually, it flies high over the forest, with a slow and buoyant flight. Specializes in flying very slowly, nearly stalling, while scanning the ground for its small prey<br>
<br>
Gymnogene is usually solitary. It is specialized in robbing nests of holes nesting birds, with its adaptive flexible knee-joints to facilitate this habit.<br>
The most unusual feature of the Gymnogene is the <b>knee joint</b>, which allows the leg to <b>bend in all directions</b>, unlike all other birds of prey, whose lower legs can move in one direction only<br>
Gymnogene to put its foot into a nest-hole of a woodpecker or other bird, then move the claws around inside to grab hold of the chicks. The most popular prey is the Cape Weaver. Once they have found a nesting colony, they hang upside-down on a nest with one foot, wings extended, with the other foot feeling around inside the nest for young chicks to extract.<br><br>

<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
A study done in South Africa showed that Gymnogene pairs occupy territories of approximately 25 square kilometers. Courtship is usually accompanied by flight displays where the male Gymnogene will dive and soar, showing off his flying skills.<br>
Both male and female birds help in nest construction, and it is interesting that 2 nests are often constructed, presumably as a second option if conditions turn out to be unsuitable at the first site.<br>
Season: Egg-laying season is from August-December, peaking from September-November.<br>
Antal: 1-3 Gymnogene eggs are creamy white, often with red-brown blotches. <br>
Bo: a platform about 75 cm wide and 20 cm deep, made of sticks and thickly lined with green leaves.<br>
Bomaterial: Preferred material(s).<br>
Construction: The nest is built by both sexes in about 30 days<br>
Boplats:  It is typically placed in the upper branches of a tree, in a cave or between the base of a bush and a cliff; it also uses the nests of other birds, such as Black Sparrowhawk and Martial Eagle. Its nest is located at the top of a tree, or in a rocky crevice near the ground.  <br>
Ruvning: mainly incubated by the female for about 35-36 days, while the male provides food to her at the nest.<br>
The chicks are fed by the male and brooded constantly by the female for the first week of their lives, after which she remains near the nest to protect them. The older chick sometimes kills its younger sibling, even if it is fully fed and supervised by an adult.<br>
The female was on the nest most of the time, to be relieved by the male when he brought prey two or three times a day.<br>

45-55d  The young leave the nest at about 45-55 days old, remaining partially dependent on their parents for at least another 10 days. stays in the vicinity for a few weeks.<br>

	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b> <br>

	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>SCARS</b><br>
	Wounds and other injuries may give scars, visible on the animal. Blind eyes will also be visible (whiteish). Also ripped/teared ears etc.
