<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
Just a single egg is laid each year and the youngster is only just gaining independence when the next breeding cycle begins.<br>
??? Gestation<br>
55d Incubation period is 55 days <br>
12w Fledging is 12 weeks.<br>
<br>
These are monogamous birds that mate for life after a courtship display of close, circling flights between an interested pair, and those courtship bonds may be renewed each year. Both prospective parents work together to build a large nest of sticks lined with grasses, and while one egg is most common, two eggs can be laid in a brood. The eggs vary from white to a pale green shade with brown spots. Only one brood is laid per year.
<br>
Both parents share incubation duties for 54-58 days, and after hatching, both parents care for their offspring for an additional 80-90 days by regurgitating food they have gorged on for the young birds to eat. The juvenile birds will remain close to their parents until the following breeding season, when they will seek out their own mates.<br>
<br>
These are colonial nesting birds that can have dozens or hundreds of mated pairs raising young in close proximity. Rare hybridizations between RÃ¼ppell's vultures and cape vultures have been recorded.<br>

AMOUNT As much as they can eat.. (weight?)<br>
FIGHTING  When vultures are feeding together at a carcass, cooperation is perhaps the last word that might come to mind, as they hiss and stomp on each other to try a get a mouthful of flesh.<br>
STYLE They employ different foraging techniques and feeding habits. One method is to gobble down chunks of flesh as quickly as possible. Griffons can fill their crop with more than 3 pounds of meat in four to five minutes. A good feed will last them at least four days before the call of an empty crop sends it out again. Some are considered â€˜the early birdâ€™ and are the first to locate carrion. Others have a preference for parts that canâ€™t be reached until after the body is dismembered by the flock. <br>

Territorial Behavior<br>
<br>
    Both sexes scent-mark<br>
    Spraying and marking define territories - function as spacing mechanisms<br>
    Patrolling and roaring used to maintain territory<br>
    Home range of a pride is largely set by biomass of prey available:<br>
    From 20 sq km to 200 sq km<br>

	Aggression<br>
<br>
    Friction among pride members is rare. Fights are short and biting infrequent - mainly vocalization and teeth-baring.
    "Kills" are disruptive to pride harmony. 
    Males will appropriate a small kill from a female. 
    Lionesses commonly take meat from cubs.
    Although smaller than males, females can react aggressively toward them. Several females may gang up to route a male
    Infanticide can occur when a new coalition of males takes over a pride. 
        More than 1/4 of all cubs are killed by invading males (Sunquist). 
        Lionesses may be killed trying to defend their cubs.

	Cub Rearing

 Lactating females can carry 3–4 kg (6.5–9 lb) of milk in their udders<br>
 Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore, and its fat content is second only to that of the polar bear and sea otter<br>
 Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young.<br>
 Females are very protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them.<br>
 
	
Activity Cycle

    Least active of all felids
    Hunt, feed and mate at all times. Behavior is influenced by season, habitat, and humans
    Nocturnal in areas where there is little cover to stalk prey or they are hunted
    20-21 hours spent resting (sleeping difficult to ascertain in the wild. Lions in zoos sleep 10-15 hours) (Haas 1958)
    2 hours walking (average = 9.5 km/day)

Daily Pattern

    Daily movement erratic and unpredictable. Remain in an area as long as there is prey 
    Activity of cubs, subadults and males is based on movement of adult lionesses
    Extremely tolerant of sun. Move in and out of shade for temperature control
    5 pm - 7 pm: (dusk): stretch, defecate, groom, play, rub cheeks
    7 pm - 6 am: roaming, eating (peaks at dusk and dawn) resting
    8 am -5 pm: resting, shift resting sites from sun to shade

	
	
	Lions can survive for long periods without water, getting much of what they need from the moisture content of their prey, however where a water source is available they will drink regularly. Lions are heat sensitive. They pant to cool down. Their body temperature is 38C to 39C.
	
	Where there is more than one female in oestrus at any given time, the female is able to make a choice as to which male to mate with. The study therefore looked at mating situations where a male mated with more than one female within an hour, on the assumption that at least one of the females was there by choice. In only 50% of examples did the females choose a male with the longest mane length, however in all but one case, the female chose the male with the darkest mane. The mane in males develops during their second year and is complete in the fifth; mane colour ranges from blond to black.
	
	Lions (although not all lions) are the only cat with a tassel at the tip of its tail, containing a hard "spur" which is separated from the last vertebra of the tail. The tuft is absent at birth, developing between 5 and 7 months old.
	
	Females sometimes die fighting to defend their cubs.
	
	 (Lions eat, in addition to antelope and wildebeest, crocodiles, pythons, fur seals, baboons, hippopotamuses, porcupines and ostrich eggs.)
	 
	 Males can outweigh females by as much as 50 percent.
	 
	 A lactating female nursed another's young rarely, usually after an unrelated cub sneaked onto her nipple. An alert lioness reserves her milk for her own offspring. In contrast to the widespread belief that cr?es were maternal utopias, Packer and Pusey found that nursing mothers stick together chiefly for defense.

	 A lone male without a brother or cousin will often team up with another singleton; if he doesn't, he is doomed to an isolated life.

	Males 10 - 12 years (up to 16), females 10 - 14 years (up to 17). Both sexes can live up to 20 - 25 years (up to 30) in captivity.
	
	Lions start to roar around 2 years-old and a fully grown lion can be heard eight kilometres (five miles) away. Roaring facilitates social cohesion and warns non-pride members to keep away. Females can distinguish the roar of the pride male from outsiders, thus being able to avoid males that may harm cubs.
	
	Male lions hunt more buffalo, while female lionesses hunt more zebra and wildebeest.
	
	Cubs are born with blue eyes that change to amber or brown when aged two to three months.
	
	Prides can attain 40 members, however the average pride, both in Kruger NP and the Serengeti, consists of 13 members. In Kruger, the average composition of 14 prides totalling 181 lions was 1.7 adult males, 4.5 adult females, 3.8 sub-adults, and 2.8 cubs (including yearlings). Females outnumber males by a substantial margin, despite a near 50% male/female birth ratio. This is probably due to the tendency of males to be nomads, take on more dangerous game, and be killed in pride takeover attempts.
	Home territories range from 20km2 in the most suitable habitats to more than 500km2. The average area of nine Serengeti prides was c. 200km2. Pride ranges and territories may overlap but each pride maintains a core area where most activities are undertaken with little interaction with other lion groups. Territories are stable except in periods of hardship. If an area becomes devoid of lions (as a result of disease for example) this will be followed by an influx of competing lions to claim the territory.
	
	Males are forced to leave the natal pride at age two to three years and enter a nomadic phase until they are large enough to challenge a sitting dominant male for control of a pride, at around five to six years old. Brothers will usually stay together and form a coalition, oftentimes joined by males ousted from other prides. Most pride tenures last around two years, however collations of three or four males often last longer. Coalitions of more than four males are rare as these coalitions often take over more females than they can defend, resulting in fewer surviving offspring.
	
	Lions have 4 teats.
	
	Pride males will spend a lot of time urine spraying territory boundaries, and all lions scuff the ground with their rear claws from the age of two-years old. 
Gestation is between 100 to 120 days.  Just prior to cubbing the female will move away from the pride and give birth in a well hidden lair.  The typical number of cubs in a litter is three (range one to six). Cubs suckle regularly for the first 6 - 7 months, the frequency declining thereafter. Cubs remain with their mother for 21 - 24 months up to 30 months 

Lions own packs. The male (or males, usually siblings) guards his territory and pack. Females hunt and care for their cubs. 

A lioness will give birth away from the rest of the pride, in a den or nest (like a cave, thicket, reed-bed or other sheltered area). The cubs are born blind, they open their eyes about a week after birth. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs. The cubs begin to crawl around a day or two after birth, and start to walk around three weeks of age. The cubs will be introduced to the pride when they are six to eight weeks old. If there are other lionesses whom have given birth at about the same time, the introduction may be earlier. 80% of cubs die before the age of 2.

Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4-5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.

IF player plays a MALE Lion. A male lion character will get attacked by the pride's male(s) when he reaches a certain age, and the player may choose to leave the pride then or earlier (as long as the character is independent from the mother). The player might form a group with an NPC (or player) sibling, or a stranger NPC male that is young enough(?) or any other player. The character may at any time try to take over a pride through battle, or through scaring away the pride's male(s). The player character may also find lone lionesses or lionesses without a male in their pride, and join/add them to the pride.[Unrelated females will rarely accept eachother] If a player character has any other lions in their pride already (npc or players, both genders) they will stay with the pride. If there are any other adult male lions in the pride played by other players, they will be "ranked" just below the nr 1 male. Either the npc in the pride "logs in" and "logs out" with the rank 1 male, or with the male who logs out last. And then "logs in" with the male who logs in first. This could be decided by the players. The players could decide which player character the pride "belongs to" (logs in and out with). If a player character belongs to a pride, that is currently not online, and the player character creates a new pride, he will leave the old one. Maybe every player character in the tribe could "own" a few npcs each (if they wish), so that there are some members of the pride there if they wish to play alone after the rest of the pride has disconnected. A lion may leave their pride at any time.<br>
A lone lioness will have more trouble being accepted by a stranger pride than a male.<br>

RÃ¼ppell's Vultures can breed with Cape Griffon.<br>
<br>
The Griffon vultures found in Africa - Ruppell's Griffon (Gyps rueppellii), Cape Griffon (Gyps coprotheres) and the African White-backed Griffon (Gyps africanus) - are very closely related to each other and interbreeding between Ruppell's Griffon and the Cape Griffon has been recorded in South Africa.
