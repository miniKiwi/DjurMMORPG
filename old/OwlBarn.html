Barn Owls are relatively common throughout most of their range. Generally common, varies with continent.<br>

<b id="colors">COLORS</b><br>
Any color morphs?<br>
Its head and upper body typically vary between a light brown and a light colored and dark grey (especially on the forehead and back) feathers in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the remiges and rectrices, which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is browner. The underparts (including the tarsometatarsus feathers) vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying amount of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It was found that at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier on average. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The bill varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue. The iris is blackish brown. The toes, as the bill, vary in color; their color ranges from pinkish to dark pinkish-grey. The talons are black.<br>
On average, within any one population males tend to be less spotted on the underside than females. The latter are also larger, as is common for owls. A strong female T. alba of a large subspecies may weigh over 550 g (19.4 oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down all over, but the heart-shaped facial disk is visible soon after hatching.<br>

<b id="markings">MARKINGS</b><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b id="interactions">INTERACTIONS / BEHAVIOUR</b><br>
	They usually roost by day in tree hollows but have also been found in caves, wells, out-buildings or thick foliage. <br>
	Barn owls are non-territorial. Adults live in overlapping home ranges, each one covering approximately 5,000 hectares. <br>
	Some pairs roost together at the nest site all year round whereas others only use the nest site whilst nesting, use different winter roost sites, and spend very little time together. <br>
	Within their home range Barn Owls generally have one nest site, up to three regular roost sites, and up to five sites that they only visit occasionally - perhaps to shelter from a shower of rain. <br>
	<br>
	WEATHER<br>
	Their soft feathers are not very waterproof so rainfall is a problem. A wet Barn Owl is unable to fly silently and a weak wet Barn Owl may be unable to fly at all. They have great difficulty hunting in high winds and during bitterly cold weather they rapidly lose body heat and need extra food. <br><br>
	 Whilst breeding, adult Barn Owls may be active (hunting, mating, feeding young) all night (about six hours in midsummer) but during the rest of the year they generally roost at least 22 out of every 24 hours. <br>
	  Typically, the owl will leave its roost site shortly after dusk and fly directly to one of its preferred hunting areas.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b>PERCHING</b> Whilst roosting, Barn Owls like to either be hidden from view or undisturbed. Provided that the owl can hide, it can easily become accustomed to almost any type of regular human activity or noise. They seem to prefer perching on wood rather than metal or stone (presumably for comfort and minimum heat loss) and well-used roost places are almost always where the owl can stay completely dry during wet weather. Given a choice of perching places a Barn Owl almost always perches as high as possible - normally at least 3 metres (10') above ground level.<br>
	  
<br>
<b id="diet">Diet</b><br><br>
<b>Preferred prey:</b> The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates, particularly <b>rodents</b>. A Barn Owl will eat anything it can subdue and that is more than a beakful, from small invertebrates weighing less than 0.05 grams to birds weighing as much as the owl itself, like the Spotted Nothura (Nothura maculosa).<br>
AMOUNT one or more rodents per night. (4 small mammals per night on average) Compared to other owls of similar size, the Barn Owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. In order to live and breed, a pair of barn owls needs to eat around 5,000 prey items a year. <br>
FIGHTING  ?<br>
<b>STYLE</b> It hunts by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. They may also use fence posts or other lookouts to ambush prey. The Barn Owl has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically for improved detection of sound position and distance, and it does not require sight to hunt. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, it can target and dive down, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize rodents with deadly accuracy.<br>
Small prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely with bones and all, while prey larger of about 100 g or more (such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats) is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Barn Owls have remarkably long legs, toes and talons enabling them to catch prey at the base of deep vegetation. The talons are extremely sharp and prey is thought to be killed by foot clenching rather than a peck.<br> Hunting usually consists of flying slowly back and forth across a patch of rough grass listening and looking downwards most of the time. When a small mammal is heard the owl hovers overhead concentrating intently on the source of the sound, pinpointing it and waiting for the best possible moment to pounce. The importance of hearing means that the bird is rarely more than three metres above the ground and whilst hovering over prey the owl may pause at about two metres before finally dropping into the grass. The final dive is usually face-first and at the last moment the head is thrown back and replaced by the feet with talons fully out-stretched.<br>
Where suitable perches are available, a "sit and wait" or "post-hunting" method is also used - particularly in winter when energy conservation is important. Occasionally the bird will drop from its perch directly onto prey but more often it will switch to flight-hunting before the pounce. Hunting techniques vary according to habitat, ambient noise level, light levels, and wind. For example when hunting mice over bare ground, such as arable stubbles or sugar beat crops, the owl may see the prey very easily and pounce immediately. Compared to voles, mice are much more likely to see or hear the owl's approach. They are also faster moving and therefore much harder to catch.<br>
Barn Owls avoid hunting between closely spaced trees. <br>
 SPEED of EATING ?<br>
 WATER ?<br>
STEAL ?<br>
<br>
<b>FLIGHT STYLE</b> Flight is noiseless, with wingbeats interrupted by gliding. Compared to most birds Barn Owls have a very low wing loading (large wings supporting a lightweight body) this means they are able to fly very slowly without stalling and hover in only the slightest lift (rising air) Almost-silent flight enables the birds to hear the tiny sounds produced by their small mammal prey and approach them undetected. <br>
<b>MIGRATION</b>
<br>
Barn Owls are especially good at detecting the high frequency <b>sounds</b> emitted by small mammals moving in vegetation, vocalising and chewing. 
<br>
No creature can see in complete darkness but Barn Owl eyes are (on average) twice as light sensitive as human eyes. <br>
However, anything that keeps absolutely still (even a human at close quarters) is usually ignored by the owl. Amazingly, the Barn Owl's dark-adapted eyes also work well in full sunlight. <br>
<br>

<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
<img src="monogamous-icon.png" width="20px"> Monogamous. Barn Owls mate for "as long as ye both shall live"...<br>
Most individuals manage to breed only once in their life, falling victim to predators or accidents before being two years of age.<br>
<b>Season:</b> <font color="purple">Maybe in the game, the breeding season could start when there is enough food. Aka if the (female?) owl character eats enough and is in top condition? Or maybe just when "summer" starts.</font> In temperate regions, the breeding season usually starts in late March to early April. Breeding can take place at any time prey is abundant, and in the warm parts of its range may occur at any time of the year. An increase in rodent populations will usually soon cause the local Barn Owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range two broods are often raised each year. Although nesting has been recorded in every month of the year, most pairs lay eggs only in the spring. (Britain) <br>
<b>Courtship:</b> During courting, males may circle near the nest tree, giving short screeches and chattering calls.  By early spring pairs are usually spending much of their time in and around their intended nest site. During courtship, or pair-bond reinforcement, the male spends more time hunting and presents additional food items to his mate or leaves them in the nest cavity. The female spends progressively less time hunting and as her weight increases from around 350g to 425g she comes into what's called "breeding condition". Copulation generally occurs each time food is presented and this, combined with her tip-top condition, helps to ensure all the eggs are fertile. However, it's not just a matter of food and sex. Most pairs also engage in mutual preening and cheek rubbing. They "talk" to each other in the nest making a wide variety of soft chittering and hissing calls, and their aerial antics (chasing while screeching) around the nest site can be quite energetic! Also, there's much individual variation. Nest cameras have revealed that some males are very active and attentive, some surprisingly lethargic, and others are hardly ever present. In almost every case the male is present at the nest site (with the female) in the two weeks leading up to egg laying and until the clutch is complete. This is when males are most vocal, defending their mate against other males and leaving only to hunt.<br>
<b>Antal:</b> 3-7 eggs. (ocassionally up to 12!) at 2 days intervals. The eggs are 38 to 46mm (1.5-1.8") long and 30 to 35mm (1.2-1.4") wide. clutches laid earlier in the year are usually larger than later ones.<br>
<b>Bo:</b> Barn Owls do not "build" a nest but just before egg laying the female usually makes a shallow scrape in the previous years' nest debris and/or breaks up a few recent pellets creating a soft layer for egg laying. Where there is no nest "cavity" as such, (for example, on a wall top or loft floor) pellets may be widely scattered and the eggs laid directly onto any surface (stone, wood, loft insulation etc.). Compared to other owl species, Barn Owls lay small eggs (in relation to their body size) and they lay lots of them.<br>
<b>Bomaterial:</b> Barn Owls do not build a nest.<br>
<b>Construction:</b> Barn Owls do not build a nest.<br>
<b>Boplats:</b> Tree hollows & rock crevices. The majority of Barn Owls nest in tree hollows up to 20 metres high. Occasionally, nesting takes place in mine shafts and caves.<br>
<b>Ruvning:</b> The male brings food to the nest as the female incubates the eggs and cares for chicks.<br>
??? Gestation<br>
30-34d Incubation<br>
3w Chicks are brooded for about two weeks. The female normally does all the incubation and once the eggs have hatched she continues to sit, brooding the young until the eldest is around three weeks old.  By this time she has been sitting almost continuously on the nest for about nine weeks and may be quite heavily soiled.<br>
??? Plumage<br>
50-55d Fledging<br>
57-67d stays w parents<br>
10m Sexual Maturity<br>
<br>
When it comes to sexual activity, nest cameras have revealed huge variation between individuals - some are very active and attentive to their mates whereas others are quite lethargic - just like people!<br>
Within their home range Barn Owls generally have one nest site, up to three regular roost sites, and up to five sites that they only visit occasionally - perhaps to shelter from a shower of rain. <br><br>
Barn Owls do not build a nest. Therefore (for egg-laying and incubation), they need a cavity-bottom or ledge that's fairly level. For example, in an old barn the nest may be on a wall top or between bales, in a derelict house it may be in an old (dry) water tank or in the loft. To use any site, the owl has to be able to get in but the absolute minimum hole size required is only 70x70mm. The minimum width of a nest ledge is around 250mm and the minimum floor area of a nest cavity is about 0.1sq. metres (300x300mm). If you are thinking of creating a suitable access hole or space for nesting please don't use these minimum figures as a guide! <br>
<br>
Once settled into their home range (after post-fledging dispersal) Barn Owls generally use the same nest and roost sites for the rest of their lives. In areas where there are plenty of suitable-looking sites for the owls to choose from, it is often unclear why they choose the sites they use and ignore others. Interestingly, when a home range is vacated for a period (because the owls have died) and later re-occupied by new owls, the sites they choose to use are often the same ones the previous residents used. This suggests that occupied sites not only have a certain appeal to individual owls, they also have "universal" appeal to Barn Owls as a species. This fascinating aspect of Barn Owl site-selection has yet to be investigated more fully.<br><br>
Although food supply is undoubtedly the biggest factor, nest safety can be a major issue at some sites. Some nest places are relatively unsafe and young Barn Owls that fall from the nest and are unable to climb (or fly) back up usually die.<br>
<br>

<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
The Barn Owl calls infrequently, the usual call being a drawn-out rasping screech.<br>
Barn Owl threat displays usually include hissing and bill-snapping.<br>
The courtship call of male at nest is a shrill repetitive twittering. Adults returning to a nest may give a low, frog-like croak. When surprised in its roosting hollow or nest, it makes hissing and rasping noises and snapping sounds that are often called bill snapping, but possibly made by clicking the tongue. <br>

	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
<b id="ill">SICKNESSES, DISEASES AND COMMON INJURIES</b><br>
Most individuals manage to breed only once in their life, falling victim to predators or accidents before being two years of age.<br>
Predators of the Barn Owl include large American opossums (Didelphis), the Common Raccoon (Procyon lotor), and similar carnivorous mammals, as well as large raptors such as hawks, eagles, and other owls. Among the latter, the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) and the Eurasian Eagle-owl (B. bubo) are noted predators of Barn Owls (though there is little evidence for predation on wild birds by Great Horned Owls).[24] Some also fall victim to large snakes, but the biggest threat are humans and their pets, in particular house or feral cats.<br>
	Predator attacks<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
