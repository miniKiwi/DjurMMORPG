AGE AND MATURITY<br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
100-120d Gestation is between 100 to 120 days. Eyes open at birth or shortly after. Litter size: 1 to 4 cubs.<br>
1-2d	Cubs begin to crawl around<br>
10d		Cubs begin to walk<br>
4-6w	Remain hidden until mobile<br>
		(The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month)<br>
6-8w	Cubs are introduced to the rest of the pride.<br>
2m		Cubs begin to eat solid food.<br>
2-3m	Eyes change from gray-blue to final color.<br>
3-5m	Spots dissappear. Permanent teeth begin to erupt.<br>
6-7m	Cubs suckle regularly for the first 6 to 7 months, then the frequency declines. Tail tuft appears. Males may have slight throat ruff. Mothers no longer have milk (7 months)<br>
13-15m	Full set of teeth gained. Males start to roar.<br>
21-30m	Cubs remain with their mother for 21 to 24 months up to 30 months. Starts to roar.<br>
Lion cubs are born with woolly, greyish coats. The coat is spotted (some more so than others), especially on the head, legs and back which aids in camouflage against their many predators, including hyena, leopard and buffalo. Most spots disappear after three months however leg spots are often visible well into adulthood.<br>
24m 	Manes noticeable in males. Both males and females reach sexual maturity around 24 months.<br>
3.5y	Males leave birth pride.<br>
4y		Most females have first litter around age 4, Most males leave the pride by the age of 4.<br>
6y		Stops growing.<br>
11y 	Female reproduction begins to decline.<br>
12-13y	Males live 12-13 years in the wild. (20-25 years in captivity)<br>
15y 	Females stop breeding.<br>
18y		Females live up to 18 years in the wild. (20-25 years in captivity)<br>

	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes screen to become dim/whiteish. (On the blind eye(s) side) <i>OBS: Eventuellt att detta 칛r effecten av gr친 starr, och "vanlig" blind ger en svart effect p친 sk칛rmen ist칛llet..?</i><br>
	<br>

	<b>Effect:</b> Speakers stop playing sound.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Broken leg</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From battle/hunting, <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (Will heal over time, but can cause death. It also may not heal very well.) Greatly decreases speed (limping animation), and agility. Maybe slight decrease to strenght. Also needs more rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open wound</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> battle/hunting <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (chance to cause infection)  More need to rest. Less agility.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Infection</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually caused by open wound. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Even more need to rest. Health going slowly down.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Poison</b> <br>

	<b>Effect:</b> Health going down, more need to rest, might roll around or show pain.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Disease</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Randomly, or by eating old or unfresh/clean food. Kan smitta. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From eating old food, small chance from eating fresh kill. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>SCARS</b><br>

	<br>
	<br>
	
	Drink daily if water is available but often go 4-5 days without water<br>
	Males can eat as much as 40 kg or one-quarter of their body weight, in one meal.<br>
	All parts of body consumed except for contents of digestive tract, horns, teeth and occasionally lungs. If a group is unable to eat all the meat at once, 1 or 2 (usually males) remain to guard the kill<br>
	Fights over a lioness in heat by male members of a pride are uncommon.<br>
	Females conceive an average on 138 days after the loss of cubs, whereas females with surviving young will not mate again until their young are more than 18 months old<br>
	Estrus: 4 days<br> 
	Interestrus Interval: 16 days <br>
Interbirth interval<br>
<br>
    20 months (11-25 months) if previous litter survives<br>
    4-6 months if litter is lost. (Pusey & Packer, 1987)<br>
    Births are synchronized by male take-overs<br>
<br>
	
Territorial Behavior<br>
<br>
    Both sexes scent-mark<br>
    Spraying and marking define territories - function as spacing mechanisms<br>
    Patrolling and roaring used to maintain territory<br>
    Home range of a pride is largely set by biomass of prey available:<br>
    From 20 sq km to 200 sq km<br>

	Aggression<br>
<br>
    Friction among pride members is rare. Fights are short and biting infrequent - mainly vocalization and teeth-baring.
    "Kills" are disruptive to pride harmony. 
    Males will appropriate a small kill from a female. 
    Lionesses commonly take meat from cubs.
    Although smaller than males, females can react aggressively toward them. Several females may gang up to route a male
    Infanticide can occur when a new coalition of males takes over a pride. 
        More than 1/4 of all cubs are killed by invading males (Sunquist). 
        Lionesses may be killed trying to defend their cubs.

	Cub Rearing

    Cubs usually left unguarded (24 hours+)
    Mothers suckle, guard and transport cubs for first few weeks.
    Communal nursing by all lactating lionesses
    Cubs subsist entirely on milk for first two months - gradually supplemented wtih meat beginning around 5 weeks
    Males often prevent cubs starvation: Will control remains of a carcass preventing lionesses from eating but allowing cubs to feed. (Cubs usually arrive late to kills)
    Males taking over a pride will attempt to kill any cubs under 1 year of age

	
Activity Cycle

    Least active of all felids
    Hunt, feed and mate at all times. Behavior is influenced by season, habitat, and humans
    Nocturnal in areas where there is little cover to stalk prey or they are hunted
    20-21 hours spent resting (sleeping difficult to ascertain in the wild. Lions in zoos sleep 10-15 hours) (Haas 1958)
    2 hours walking (average = 9.5 km/day)

Daily Pattern

    Daily movement erratic and unpredictable. Remain in an area as long as there is prey 
    Activity of cubs, subadults and males is based on movement of adult lionesses
    Extremely tolerant of sun. Move in and out of shade for temperature control
    5 pm - 7 pm: (dusk): stretch, defecate, groom, play, rub cheeks
    7 pm - 6 am: roaming, eating (peaks at dusk and dawn) resting
    8 am -5 pm: resting, shift resting sites from sun to shade

	
	
	Lions can survive for long periods without water, getting much of what they need from the moisture content of their prey, however where a water source is available they will drink regularly. Lions are heat sensitive. They pant to cool down. Their body temperature is 38C to 39C.
	
	Where there is more than one female in oestrus at any given time, the female is able to make a choice as to which male to mate with. The study therefore looked at mating situations where a male mated with more than one female within an hour, on the assumption that at least one of the females was there by choice. In only 50% of examples did the females choose a male with the longest mane length, however in all but one case, the female chose the male with the darkest mane. The mane in males develops during their second year and is complete in the fifth; mane colour ranges from blond to black.
	
	Lions (although not all lions) are the only cat with a tassel at the tip of its tail, containing a hard "spur" which is separated from the last vertebra of the tail. The tuft is absent at birth, developing between 5 and 7 months old.
	
	Females sometimes die fighting to defend their cubs.
	
	 (Lions eat, in addition to antelope and wildebeest, crocodiles, pythons, fur seals, baboons, hippopotamuses, porcupines and ostrich eggs.)
	 
	 Males can outweigh females by as much as 50 percent.
	 
	 A lactating female nursed another's young rarely, usually after an unrelated cub sneaked onto her nipple. An alert lioness reserves her milk for her own offspring. In contrast to the widespread belief that cr朴hes were maternal utopias, Packer and Pusey found that nursing mothers stick together chiefly for defense.

	 A lone male without a brother or cousin will often team up with another singleton; if he doesn't, he is doomed to an isolated life.

	Males 10 - 12 years (up to 16), females 10 - 14 years (up to 17). Both sexes can live up to 20 - 25 years (up to 30) in captivity.
	
	Lions start to roar around 2 years-old and a fully grown lion can be heard eight kilometres (five miles) away. Roaring facilitates social cohesion and warns non-pride members to keep away. Females can distinguish the roar of the pride male from outsiders, thus being able to avoid males that may harm cubs.
	
	Male lions hunt more buffalo, while female lionesses hunt more zebra and wildebeest.
	
	Cubs are born with blue eyes that change to amber or brown when aged two to three months.
	
	Prides can attain 40 members, however the average pride, both in Kruger NP and the Serengeti, consists of 13 members. In Kruger, the average composition of 14 prides totalling 181 lions was 1.7 adult males, 4.5 adult females, 3.8 sub-adults, and 2.8 cubs (including yearlings). Females outnumber males by a substantial margin, despite a near 50% male/female birth ratio. This is probably due to the tendency of males to be nomads, take on more dangerous game, and be killed in pride takeover attempts.
	Home territories range from 20km2 in the most suitable habitats to more than 500km2. The average area of nine Serengeti prides was c. 200km2. Pride ranges and territories may overlap but each pride maintains a core area where most activities are undertaken with little interaction with other lion groups. Territories are stable except in periods of hardship. If an area becomes devoid of lions (as a result of disease for example) this will be followed by an influx of competing lions to claim the territory.
	
	Males are forced to leave the natal pride at age two to three years and enter a nomadic phase until they are large enough to challenge a sitting dominant male for control of a pride, at around five to six years old. Brothers will usually stay together and form a coalition, oftentimes joined by males ousted from other prides. Most pride tenures last around two years, however collations of three or four males often last longer. Coalitions of more than four males are rare as these coalitions often take over more females than they can defend, resulting in fewer surviving offspring.
	
	Lions have 4 teats.
	
	Pride males will spend a lot of time urine spraying territory boundaries, and all lions scuff the ground with their rear claws from the age of two-years old. 
Gestation is between 100 to 120 days.  Just prior to cubbing the female will move away from the pride and give birth in a well hidden lair.  The typical number of cubs in a litter is three (range one to six). Cubs suckle regularly for the first 6 - 7 months, the frequency declining thereafter. Cubs remain with their mother for 21 - 24 months up to 30 months 

Lions own packs. The male (or males, usually siblings) guards his territory and pack. Females hunt and care for their cubs. 

A lioness will give birth away from the rest of the pride, in a den or nest (like a cave, thicket, reed-bed or other sheltered area). The cubs are born blind, they open their eyes about a week after birth. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs. The cubs begin to crawl around a day or two after birth, and start to walk around three weeks of age. The cubs will be introduced to the pride when they are six to eight weeks old. If there are other lionesses whom have given birth at about the same time, the introduction may be earlier. 80% of cubs die before the age of 2.

Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4-5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.

IF player plays a MALE Lion. A male lion character will get attacked by the pride's male(s) when he reaches a certain age, and the player may choose to leave the pride then or earlier (as long as the character is independent from the mother). The player might form a group with an NPC (or player) sibling, or a stranger NPC male that is young enough(?) or any other player. The character may at any time try to take over a pride through battle, or through scaring away the pride's male(s). The player character may also find lone lionesses or lionesses without a male in their pride, and join/add them to the pride.[Unrelated females will rarely accept eachother] If a player character has any other lions in their pride already (npc or players, both genders) they will stay with the pride. If there are any other adult male lions in the pride played by other players, they will be "ranked" just below the nr 1 male. Either the npc in the pride "logs in" and "logs out" with the rank 1 male, or with the male who logs out last. And then "logs in" with the male who logs in first. This could be decided by the players. The players could decide which player character the pride "belongs to" (logs in and out with). If a player character belongs to a pride, that is currently not online, and the player character creates a new pride, he will leave the old one. Maybe every player character in the tribe could "own" a few npcs each (if they wish), so that there are some members of the pride there if they wish to play alone after the rest of the pride has disconnected. A lion may leave their pride at any time.<br>
A lone lioness will have more trouble being accepted by a stranger pride than a male.<br>

Lions can breed with <a href="AfricanLeopard.html">leopards</a>, <a href="#">tigers</a>, asian lion<br>
<br>
 The hybrids have characteristics of both the Asian and the African species, but have poor immune systems and are disease-prone.
As well as partial fertility and growth dysplasia, some hybrid big cats exhibit emotional or behavioural conflicts due to their mixed ancestry. They may also inherit different or mixed vocabularies (tigers "chuff", lions roar). Hybrids inherit different, sometimes conflicting, behavioural traits from the two parent species. A purebred mother may also become confused by her hybrid offspring's unusual behaviour. Lions rarely climb trees or play in water. A lioness who produced leopon (leopard x lioness) cubs was reportedly distressed by her offspring's tendency to climb trees and play in water. These traits were inherited from their leopard father. Tigons may also inherit a fascination with water to the distress or confusion of their lioness mother.
<br>
Ligers and tigons may exhibit conflicts between the social habits of the lion and the solitary habits of the tiger. Their lion heritage wants them to form prides, but their tiger heritage urges them to be intolerant of company.  Opponents of deliberate hybridization say this causes confusion and depression for the animals, especially after sexual maturity.  How much of their behaviour is due to conflicting instincts and how much is due to abnormal hormones or the stress of captive conditions is not fully known.<br>Because hybrid males are mostly infertile, female hybrids are mated back to pure-bred animals.<br>
Hybridisation is frequently a dead end because the hybrids are not fully fertile. If the hybrids are fertile, they are usually absorbed back into the population of one or other parent species and most of the alien genes are bred out.<br>
 However, the mitochondrial DNA come from the original tiger mother. In later generations, the male hybrids become genetically close enough to being all lion to be fertile and can breed with lionesses. Only at that point is the original tiger mitochondrial DNA lost.<br>
