<b id="interactions">INTERACTIONS / BEHAVIOUR</b><br>
In the wild Fire Finches live in large groups and usually found in savannah woodland. They are the most widespread and common of the African birds and abundant around human habitats. Fire Finches predominantly feed on the ground, consuming seeds of various weeds and some insects.<br>
Fire finches, in their natural environment, eat small seeds of grasses and herbs, and small insects. <br>

Säsong: Egg-laying season is almost year-round, peaking from December-June.<br>
Antal: Honan lägger 3-6 helvita ägg.<br>
Bo: Domformad konstruktion med ingången på sidan.<br>
Bomaterial: Torrt gräs. Båda föräldrarna hämtar bomaterial till boet?, men bara hanen bygger. Boet tar ca 5-7 dagar att bygga.<br>
Boplats: I buskar.<br>
Ruvning: Både honan och hanen ruvar.<br>
<!-- Honan lägger 3-6 helvita ägg.  Som byggmaterial används torrt gräs och boet utformas så att dess ingång finns på sidan. Artens bo är en domformad konstruktion som byggs i buskar eller i anslutning till människans byggnader.<br>
The nest is built solely by the male, consisting of a ball-shaped structure with a side entrance, made of dry grass blades with an inner shell of grass inflorescences, lined with feathers. It is typically placed in plant debris beneath a tree or bush, alternatively in a thatch roof, hedge or hole in a wall. 
Firefinch chicks are dark skinned, covered in scarce
dark down and have conspicuous throats, palates and beak light reflecting
nodes to aid their parents finding them inside the dark nest (these should be
very easy to identify by Gouldian Finch breeders). Some parasitic species have
taken advantage of such marking. With Firefinches, widowbirds or whydahs
from the genus Vidua are common nest parasites.<br>
 Both parents bring nesting materials, and typically a nest is completed within five to seven days.<br> -->

<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
Firefinches are not talented singers, in fact, most specimens do not sing
at all nor have the ability to. Most species communicate through a series of
quiet low beeps, tweets, queet, swits, tsiu and pips. Any person searching for a
song finch should stay away from Firefinches.<br>

	Predator attacks<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes screen to become dim/whiteish. (On the blind eye(s) side) <i>OBS: Eventuellt att detta ?effecten av gr?tarr, och "vanlig" blind ger en svart effect p?k?en ist?et..?</i><br>

	<br>
	<b>Broken leg</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From battle/hunting, <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (Will heal over time, but can cause death. It also may not heal very well.) Greatly decreases speed (limping animation), and agility. Maybe slight decrease to strenght. Also needs more rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open wound</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> battle/hunting <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (chance to cause infection)  More need to rest. Less agility.<br>

	<b>Disease</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Randomly, or by eating old or unfresh/clean food. Kan smitta. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From eating old food, small chance from eating fresh kill. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>

<br>
	
Territorial Behavior<br>
<br>
    Both sexes scent-mark<br>
    Spraying and marking define territories - function as spacing mechanisms<br>
    Patrolling and roaring used to maintain territory<br>
    Home range of a pride is largely set by biomass of prey available:<br>
    From 20 sq km to 200 sq km<br>

	Aggression<br>
<br>
    Friction among pride members is rare. Fights are short and biting infrequent - mainly vocalization and teeth-baring.
    "Kills" are disruptive to pride harmony. 
    Males will appropriate a small kill from a female. 
    Lionesses commonly take meat from cubs.
    Although smaller than males, females can react aggressively toward them. Several females may gang up to route a male
    Infanticide can occur when a new coalition of males takes over a pride. 
        More than 1/4 of all cubs are killed by invading males (Sunquist). 
        Lionesses may be killed trying to defend their cubs.

	Cub Rearing

 Lactating females can carry 3? kg (6.5? lb) of milk in their udders<br>
 Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore, and its fat content is second only to that of the polar bear and sea otter<br>
 Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young.<br>
 Females are very protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them.<br>
 
	
Activity Cycle

    Least active of all felids
    Hunt, feed and mate at all times. Behavior is influenced by season, habitat, and humans
    Nocturnal in areas where there is little cover to stalk prey or they are hunted
    20-21 hours spent resting (sleeping difficult to ascertain in the wild. Lions in zoos sleep 10-15 hours) (Haas 1958)
    2 hours walking (average = 9.5 km/day)

Daily Pattern

    Daily movement erratic and unpredictable. Remain in an area as long as there is prey 
    Activity of cubs, subadults and males is based on movement of adult lionesses
    Extremely tolerant of sun. Move in and out of shade for temperature control
    5 pm - 7 pm: (dusk): stretch, defecate, groom, play, rub cheeks
    7 pm - 6 am: roaming, eating (peaks at dusk and dawn) resting
    8 am -5 pm: resting, shift resting sites from sun to shade

	
	
	Lions can survive for long periods without water, getting much of what they need from the moisture content of their prey, however where a water source is available they will drink regularly. Lions are heat sensitive. They pant to cool down. Their body temperature is 38C to 39C.
	
	Where there is more than one female in oestrus at any given time, the female is able to make a choice as to which male to mate with. The study therefore looked at mating situations where a male mated with more than one female within an hour, on the assumption that at least one of the females was there by choice. In only 50% of examples did the females choose a male with the longest mane length, however in all but one case, the female chose the male with the darkest mane. The mane in males develops during their second year and is complete in the fifth; mane colour ranges from blond to black.
	
	Lions (although not all lions) are the only cat with a tassel at the tip of its tail, containing a hard "spur" which is separated from the last vertebra of the tail. The tuft is absent at birth, developing between 5 and 7 months old.
	
	Females sometimes die fighting to defend their cubs.
	
	 (Lions eat, in addition to antelope and wildebeest, crocodiles, pythons, fur seals, baboons, hippopotamuses, porcupines and ostrich eggs.)
	 
	 Males can outweigh females by as much as 50 percent.
	 
	 A lactating female nursed another's young rarely, usually after an unrelated cub sneaked onto her nipple. An alert lioness reserves her milk for her own offspring. In contrast to the widespread belief that cr?es were maternal utopias, Packer and Pusey found that nursing mothers stick together chiefly for defense.

	 A lone male without a brother or cousin will often team up with another singleton; if he doesn't, he is doomed to an isolated life.

	Males 10 - 12 years (up to 16), females 10 - 14 years (up to 17). Both sexes can live up to 20 - 25 years (up to 30) in captivity.
	
	Lions start to roar around 2 years-old and a fully grown lion can be heard eight kilometres (five miles) away. Roaring facilitates social cohesion and warns non-pride members to keep away. Females can distinguish the roar of the pride male from outsiders, thus being able to avoid males that may harm cubs.
	
	Male lions hunt more buffalo, while female lionesses hunt more zebra and wildebeest.
	
	Cubs are born with blue eyes that change to amber or brown when aged two to three months.
	
	Prides can attain 40 members, however the average pride, both in Kruger NP and the Serengeti, consists of 13 members. In Kruger, the average composition of 14 prides totalling 181 lions was 1.7 adult males, 4.5 adult females, 3.8 sub-adults, and 2.8 cubs (including yearlings). Females outnumber males by a substantial margin, despite a near 50% male/female birth ratio. This is probably due to the tendency of males to be nomads, take on more dangerous game, and be killed in pride takeover attempts.
	Home territories range from 20km2 in the most suitable habitats to more than 500km2. The average area of nine Serengeti prides was c. 200km2. Pride ranges and territories may overlap but each pride maintains a core area where most activities are undertaken with little interaction with other lion groups. Territories are stable except in periods of hardship. If an area becomes devoid of lions (as a result of disease for example) this will be followed by an influx of competing lions to claim the territory.
	
	Males are forced to leave the natal pride at age two to three years and enter a nomadic phase until they are large enough to challenge a sitting dominant male for control of a pride, at around five to six years old. Brothers will usually stay together and form a coalition, oftentimes joined by males ousted from other prides. Most pride tenures last around two years, however collations of three or four males often last longer. Coalitions of more than four males are rare as these coalitions often take over more females than they can defend, resulting in fewer surviving offspring.
	
	Lions have 4 teats.
	
	Pride males will spend a lot of time urine spraying territory boundaries, and all lions scuff the ground with their rear claws from the age of two-years old. 
Gestation is between 100 to 120 days.  Just prior to cubbing the female will move away from the pride and give birth in a well hidden lair.  The typical number of cubs in a litter is three (range one to six). Cubs suckle regularly for the first 6 - 7 months, the frequency declining thereafter. Cubs remain with their mother for 21 - 24 months up to 30 months 

Lions own packs. The male (or males, usually siblings) guards his territory and pack. Females hunt and care for their cubs. 

A lioness will give birth away from the rest of the pride, in a den or nest (like a cave, thicket, reed-bed or other sheltered area). The cubs are born blind, they open their eyes about a week after birth. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs. The cubs begin to crawl around a day or two after birth, and start to walk around three weeks of age. The cubs will be introduced to the pride when they are six to eight weeks old. If there are other lionesses whom have given birth at about the same time, the introduction may be earlier. 80% of cubs die before the age of 2.

Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4-5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.

IF player plays a MALE Lion. A male lion character will get attacked by the pride's male(s) when he reaches a certain age, and the player may choose to leave the pride then or earlier (as long as the character is independent from the mother). The player might form a group with an NPC (or player) sibling, or a stranger NPC male that is young enough(?) or any other player. The character may at any time try to take over a pride through battle, or through scaring away the pride's male(s). The player character may also find lone lionesses or lionesses without a male in their pride, and join/add them to the pride.[Unrelated females will rarely accept eachother] If a player character has any other lions in their pride already (npc or players, both genders) they will stay with the pride. If there are any other adult male lions in the pride played by other players, they will be "ranked" just below the nr 1 male. Either the npc in the pride "logs in" and "logs out" with the rank 1 male, or with the male who logs out last. And then "logs in" with the male who logs in first. This could be decided by the players. The players could decide which player character the pride "belongs to" (logs in and out with). If a player character belongs to a pride, that is currently not online, and the player character creates a new pride, he will leave the old one. Maybe every player character in the tribe could "own" a few npcs each (if they wish), so that there are some members of the pride there if they wish to play alone after the rest of the pride has disconnected. A lion may leave their pride at any time.<br>
A lone lioness will have more trouble being accepted by a stranger pride than a male.<br>
