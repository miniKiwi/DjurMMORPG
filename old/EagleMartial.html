<b id="colors">APPEARANCE</b><br>
The adult's plumage consists of dark grey-brown coloration on the upperparts, head and upper chest, with slightly lighter edging to these feathers. The body underparts are white with blackish-brown spotting. The underwing coverts are brown, with pale flight feathers being streaked with black. The female is usually larger and more spotted than the male. The immature is paler above, often whitish on the head and chest, and has less spotted underparts. It reaches adult plumage in its seventh year. Martial Eagles have a short erectile crest, which is often not prominent. It often perches in a quite upright position, with its long wings completely covering the tail. The bill, at 5.5 cm (2.2 in), is strong and the legs are feathered to the heavy, powerful feet.[2] There are few serious identification challenges for the species. The Black-chested Snake Eagle is smaller, with a relatively more prominent head and white lining the flight feathers. The Crowned Eagle, which also regularly perches in an erect position, has distinctly shorter wings and a distinctly longer tail and, though its plumage is fairly variable, it is more scaled on the back and it has distinctive barring on the underparts and the wings. More so than any other African eagle, the Martial Eagle is often seen only in flight.<br>

	The Martial Eagle is one of the world's most powerful avian predators and, among African raptors, only the Crowned Eagle is comparable in predatory dominance. The Martial Eagle is an apex predator, being at the top of the avian food chain in its environment and, if in healthy condition, having no natural predators.<br>
Martial eagles have been noted as remarkable for their extremely keen eyesight (3.0–3.6 times human acuity). Due to this power, <b>they can spot potential prey from a very great distance</b>. With its excellent <b>eyesight</b> they can <b>spot prey from up to five kilometers away</b>.</b>
It spends much of its time on the wing, and is usually seen soaring about hill slopes, often at a very great height rendering it almost invisible to the naked eye. Early in the morning before it takes to the wing for the day, or in the evening prior to roosting it can be seen perced in trees.<br>
It will soar for hours on updraughts without hunting, and with a full crop, but it does most of its hunting from the soar also, killing or attacking by a long slanting stoop at great speed, or a gentle descent into an opening in the bush, the speed of the descent being controlled by the angle at which the wings are held above the back. It may kill from a perch, but does so seldom, and most of its kills are surprised in the open by the speed of the eagle's attack from a distance.<br>
A pair of Martial Eagles may have a home range of anything up to 50 square miles, and they wander about over most of it. They often hunt for several days in one area and then move on to another, since complaints of kills are often voiced for several days in succession in the same area. It is much shier than the other big eagles of Africa, and generally keeps away from man.<br>
Their short <b>crest</b> is rarely exposed except when in a heightened state of alertness<br>
Unusually for a bird of its size, <b>it may hover</b> while hunting.<br>

STRENGTH<br>
They reputedly have enough power in one foot to break a man's arm. <br>

<b id="diet">Diet</b><br><br>
PREFERED PREY 
Martial Eagles feed on gamebirds, hares, hyraxes, small antelopes, monitor lizards and other medium sized vertebrates.  It is not known to eat carrion at all except possibly dead lambs.<br>

<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
<img src="monogamous-icon.png" width="20px"> Martial Eagles are monogamous, and mate for life.<br>
Pairs have one or two nests, which are used in alternate years if more than one, but for successive breeding attempts if only one.<br>
Season: There is no set breeding period for the Martial Eagle and it depends on their location as to when they will breed. In the Sudan the mating season is in January to June while in Senegal it is from November to April. In other parts of Africa the breeding season can be almost any month but the most common time of year seems to be April to July. Egg-laying season is from February-August, peaking from April-June. They raise new young every <b>two</b> years.<br>
Antal: 1-2. Two is rare.<br>
Bo: They are huge structures about four to six feet across and up to four feet thick, and often basin-shaped when new - much broader than they are deep.<br>
Bomaterial: They are made of large sticks up to one-and-a-half inches in diameter, lined with green leaves.<br>
Construction: The female builds the nest over a period of 2-3 weeks.<br>
Boplats: Nests are built invariably in trees, at any height from 20 to 80 feet above ground, but often in the largest tree in the area, growing on a steep hillside or in a gorge, where the bird has a clear sweep off the nest.<br>
Ruvning: Incubation is normally by the female, but a male has been known to sit. The female leaves the nest to feed and is not usually fed by the male at the nest.<br>
??? Gestation<br>
45-50d Incubation. <br>
14d The young one is closely brooded in its first few days, but after fourteen days the female does not brood it except at night.<br>
2-3w The chick is brooded almost constantly by the female for 2-3 weeks, after which she starts to assist the male with hunting to provide for their young<br>
20d Young become more active<br>
32d Feathers start coming<br>
60d Start to tear prey by it's own<br>
70d Completely covered in feathers<br>
90-100d After hatching: Fledging<br>
6m May still be seen near nest area. The fledgling leaves it's parents' territory at the start of the following breeding season.<br>
2-3y Independent.<br>

	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
