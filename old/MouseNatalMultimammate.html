<br>
 This species is widespread in subsaharan Africa, except for the southwestern portion of continent. It has a very wide elevational range.  	It is an extremely common, commensal species. <br>
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, urban areas, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.<br>
<br>
<b id="colors">COLORS</b><br>
Colour mutations:<br>
Multimammate mice are now seen in quite a variety of colours including the natural agouti brown (AA). Note: genetic symbols are for demonstration purposes only as there is not to my knowledge any clear-cut genetic information available on the multimammate mouse.
<br>
Cinnamon: (aa) similar to agouti but lacking the black ticking to each hair and so has a much paler look to the fur. I believe this to be a recessive gene.
<br>
Pied: any colour with large patched of white. This appears to be a co-dominant gene as whenever I have bred a pied to a self coloured animal I gets both pieds and selfs cropping up in litters. There are two distinct markings seen in pied animals – white animals with saddles of colour across the back and coloured animals with a white blaze or ‘badger’ marking on the face. Again I get both occurring in litters.
<br>
Red-eyed cinnamon (rr): sometimes referred to as champagne or argente, it is a very pale cream with a slate grey under coat and bright pink eyes. As it is a recessive gene all red-eyed animals are homozygous and cannot carry any other genes. Red-eyed carriers (heterozygous agoutis) have a colouration similar to that of a cinnamon but are still agouti.<br>

	This is a species that will eventually chew out of anything that isn’t made of metal or glass.
<br>
 A real attraction of this species is that unlike fancy mice (mus musculus) even the males have no obvious odour.<br>
 They need a deep level of substrate since they enjoy burrowing and it is important to provide nest boxes, bedding and hay for privacy.<br>
  Djuren älskar att sandbada i fin fågelsand!<br>
  Arten lever i sociala flockar.<br>
   Although Multimammate Rats prefer to live in colonies, rather than as pairs – and in the wild several females will live harmoniously together in one burrow – they do form monogamous pairs.<br>
   At one point I had as many as 78 animals in a (very) large cage, but even at this high density there did not appear to be any aggression within the group.<br>
   Chris Henwood noted that occasionally individuals will destroy entire litters of babies, as well as cannibalising dead cage companions. He stresses that attacks on cage mates are rare, as is the nibbling of ears and tails, but, when slight damage such as this is inflicted, the victim often seems to make no attempt to escape its persecutor. <br>
   Let us deal with these observations systematically. I have found that, in a group situation, pups born in the open are invariably killed but, once nesting boxes are provided, the rearing rate is very good, even when the cage is slightly overcrowded.<br>
   It seems that neonatal mortality can be attributed to inexperienced mothers, as this phenomenon seems to be commonest with a doe's first litter, or to a lack of privacy. <br>
   Multimammate Rats are surprisingly tolerant of other species and, being less territorial than the Domestic or Fancy Rat Rattus norvegicus, will usually accept strangers into their midst, something which is almost impossible with some rodents. <br>
   Although terrestrial, it is adept at climbing and can even ascend dangling strings.<br>
   It also swims well but is less competent at digging, although it will gouge its own burrow in soft or cracked ground if it is unable to find a rock crevice or abandoned burrow of some other animal.<br>
   Multimammate Rats are active animals<br>
   Sight is not so important as the sense of smell<br>

<b id="ages">AGE AND MATURITY</b><br> <!-- Edit this to a nice timeline! -->
Multimammate mice feed their babies on what is known as the ‘aunty system’ where by females in the colony will feed any babies regardless of whether they are hers or not. In some instances the female will not even need to get pregnant herself in order to lactate for another females offspring. It is down to this strong maternal instinct that the species owes its success and ultimately is what has led it to become such a pest in Africa. <br>
 Om en hona i en stor grupp honor får ungar så hjälper alla honor till med att ta hand om ungarna. <br>
 Dom boar, ger di, tvättar, skyddar och värmer ungarna med omsorg. Nataler behöver kött för att kunna producera mjölk till sina ungar.<br>
 Females have 8-12 pairs of teats, rather than the usual 5 or 6 pairs possessed by other small rodents, but as many as 16-18 pairs are not unknown.<br>
Monogamous?<br>
<b>Season:</b> It breeds throughout the year, but breeding peaks towards the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season when vegetation is at its most luxuriant and food most easily attainable.<br>
<b>Oestrus:</b> The oestrus cycle is 7-8 days. They experience a postpartum oestrus.<br>
<b>Courtship:</b> the male needs to be able to pursue and catch the female before mating with her. Without this essential "foreplay" the female does not always conceive.<br>
<b>Antal:</b> (1-)6-22 (8-13)<br>
<b>Bo:</b> less competent at digging, although it will gouge its own burrow in soft or cracked ground if it is unable to find a rock crevice or abandoned burrow of some other animal.  Burrows which it digs itself are usually a network of galleries without a central chamber. Those used for nesting are generally more extensive than those used at other times or for other purposes. <br>
<b>Bomaterial:</b> Preferred material(s).<br>
<b>Construction:</b> Who builds? How long does it take?<br>
<b>Boplats:</b> <br>
males remain with the females after the babies are born, often standing guard at the entrance to the burrow.<br>
21-26d (23d) Gestation.<br>
Birth weight is about 1.8g. At birth the young are blind and covered with sparse hairs.<br>
14-16d Eyes open at 14-16 days. <br>
21-24d They are weaned at 21-24 days but remain in the nest for several more days even though the female may have another litter within 25 days of the first birth.<br>
5-6w Leaves mother?<br>
<!-- 2m Stays in parents' territory<br> -->
2m-3½m Sexual maturity is attained at 3½ months.<br>
2-3y Males live up to 3 years; females to about 2 years old, but occasionally older animals have been recorded. The wide age discrepancy between the sexes is probably the result of stress imposed on the female during breeding activities. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
African Pygmy Falcon is noisy during the breeding season, uttering high-pitched calls and songs “twee-twee-twip” or “kiki-kik” used by the male. It also gives thin, squeaky “tsip-tsip”. Calls are often high-pitched.<br>
The young give sharp “ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki” when alarmed.<br>
While uttering these sounds, the bird bobs the head and moves the tail up and down. <br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
<b id="ill">SICKNESSES, DISEASES AND COMMON INJURIES</b><br>
	Predator attacks<br>
	Being so numerous and relatively conspicuous in its natural haunts, the species finds itself prey to a wide variety of carnivores, especially owls, but also civets, genets, eagles and snakes<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes screen to become dim/whiteish. (On the blind eye(s) side) <i>OBS: Eventuellt att detta ?effecten av gr?tarr, och "vanlig" blind ger en svart effect p?k?en ist?et..?</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>Deaf (One or both ears)</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually born with. (Might increase with age.)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Speakers stop playing sound.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Broken leg</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From battle/hunting, <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (Will heal over time, but can cause death. It also may not heal very well.) Greatly decreases speed (limping animation), and agility. Maybe slight decrease to strenght. Also needs more rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open wound</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> battle/hunting <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (chance to cause infection)  More need to rest. Less agility.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Infection</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually caused by open wound. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Even more need to rest. Health going slowly down.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Poison</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Caused by eating poisonous food, or maybe old food. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Health going down, more need to rest, might roll around or show pain.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Disease</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Randomly, or by eating old or unfresh/clean food. Kan smitta. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From eating old food, small chance from eating fresh kill. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>SCARS</b><br>
	Wounds and other injuries may give scars, visible on the animal. Blind eyes will also be visible (whiteish). Also ripped/teared ears etc.
