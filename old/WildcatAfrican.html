 Falbkatten förekommer i hela Afrika med undantag av ökenområden och tropiska regnskogar<br>
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, urban areas, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.<br>
<br>
<b id="colors">COLORS</b><br>
Colour mutations?<br>
The fur colour of the African wildcat is light sandy grey, and sometimes with a pale yellow or reddish hue. The ears are reddish to grey, with long light yellow hairs around the pinna. Stripes around the face are dark ochre to black: two are running horizontally on the cheek, and four to six across the throat. A dark stripe is running along the back, the flanks are lighter, and the belly is whitish. Pale vertical stripes on the sides often dissolve into spots. Two dark rings are on the forelegs, and hind legs are striped. The feet are dark brown to black.<br>
Pocock described the African wildcat as differing from the European wildcat by inconspicuous stripes on the nape and shoulders, a less sharply defined stripe on the spinal area and by the slender tail, which is cylindrical, less bushy and more tapering. Ears are normally tipped with a small tuft.<br><br>
The fur is shorter than of the European wildcat, and it is considerably smaller.<br>
The African Wild Cat is similar in appearance to a domestic cat; however, it is proportionally larger and has longer hind legs. <br>
Cats in the drier western portion of the subregion are a light sandy ground colour with brown or rufous markings. In the eastern potion, they are light grey with charcoal or black markings; there is a wide area with intermediate colouring. A dark stripe runs along the midline of the back and neck, 2 distinct stripes circle the neck and there are 6-7 vertical stripes on the flanks. The legs are banded; markings are more distinct on lower limbs. Relatively long tail dark-ringed with black tip. Chin and throat are while and the chest in typically more pale than the rest of the body. Belly typically reddish. Backs of ears are coloured a rich reddish-brown. The average shoulder height is 35 cm. Total length is 85-100cm, tail 25-37cm. Weight is anywhere from 2.5-6.0kg. <br>

	<b id="behaviour">BEHAVIOUR</b><br>
<br>
 In the daytime it usually hides in the bushes, although it is sometimes active on dark, cloudy days. The territory of a male overlaps with that of a few females, who defend the territory against intruders.<br>
 These cats are solitary except when mating or when females are accompanied by kittens.<br>
 Spends most of the time on the ground, but is an agile climber and readily flees into trees if pursued. <br>
 They depend on cover to hide during the day. This includes holes in the ground, caves, rock crevices and burrows dug by other animals. <br>
 Both males and females establish territories which they mark and defend. The territory of a male overlaps with that of a few females, who defend the territory against intruders.<br>
 The males and females both spray urine to mark their territories and scat is buried in the manner of a domestic cat. <br>
 Spitting with the ears flattened is a defensive threat, while arching the back and tail and fluffing up the hair is a neutral threat. Caterwauling precedes aggression.<br>
 Well, it's not a problem unless the female is heat. She wouldn't be fertile unless this were the case, plus, she most likely wouldn't stand for the male, resulting in any interest being a full on cat fight<br>

<b id="diet">Diet</b><br><br>
<b>PREFERRED FOOD</b> The African wildcat eats primarily <b>mice, rats and other small mammals.</b> When the opportunity arises, it also eats birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Largest recorded prey is hares, springhares and birds up to the size of guineafowl.<br>
AMOUNT ?<br>
FIGHTING  ?<br>
<b>HUNTING STYLE</b> The cat approaches its prey slowly, and attacks by pouncing on its prey as soon as it is within range (about one metre). African Wild Cats detect prey by sight or sound, stalks in crouch with head low, using cover. They rush forward to prey and pounce with the claws of the forefeet. Precise killing bites are used; where they are directed depend on prey size.<br>

<b id="sounds">SOUNDS</b><br>
African Pygmy Falcon is noisy during the breeding season, uttering high-pitched calls and songs “twee-twee-twip” or “kiki-kik” used by the male. It also gives thin, squeaky “tsip-tsip”. Calls are often high-pitched.<br>
The young give sharp “ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki” when alarmed.<br>
While uttering these sounds, the bird bobs the head and moves the tail up and down. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b id="interactions">INTERACTIONS</b><br>
	<b>Move in Slowmotion</b> (on/off) - Upon meeting a stranger cat. If not, may cause a catfight.<br>

	<b>Hiss</b> - Defensive gesture. "Do not come any closer!"<br>
	<b>???</b> - Throw oneself on back and hiss, all paws in the air. Either instantly followed by a fight, or the other cat freezes for a moment in a stare position, ears back.<br>

	<br>

	<br><br>
<b id="ill">SICKNESSES, DISEASES AND COMMON INJURIES</b><br>
	Predator attacks<br>
Predators: Wild cats are preyed upon as young cats by larger predators, such as foxes, wolves, other cats, and large birds of prey, such as owls, eagles and hawks. African Wild cats are fierce when threatened and can protect themselves from animals larger than themselves.


	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Blind (one or both eyes) </b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Injury (fight/hunting)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes screen to become dim/whiteish. (On the blind eye(s) side) <i>OBS: Eventuellt att detta ?effecten av gr?tarr, och "vanlig" blind ger en svart effect p?k?en ist?et..?</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>Deaf (One or both ears)</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually born with. (Might increase with age.)<br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Speakers stop playing sound.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Broken leg</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From battle/hunting, <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (Will heal over time, but can cause death. It also may not heal very well.) Greatly decreases speed (limping animation), and agility. Maybe slight decrease to strenght. Also needs more rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open wound</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> battle/hunting <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> (chance to cause infection)  More need to rest. Less agility.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Infection</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Usually caused by open wound. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Even more need to rest. Health going slowly down.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Poison</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Caused by eating poisonous food, or maybe old food. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Health going down, more need to rest, might roll around or show pain.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Disease</b><br>
	<b>Cause:</b> Randomly, or by eating old or unfresh/clean food. Kan smitta. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> More need to rest. Health slowly going down. Slightly less speed. Takes different amounts of time to heal/dissappear.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Worms</b> <br>
	<b>Cause:</b> From eating old food, small chance from eating fresh kill. <br>
	<b>Effect:</b> Causes more need to eat, will have to eat more or will starve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>SCARS</b><br>
	Wounds and other injuries may give scars, visible on the animal. Blind eyes will also be visible (whiteish). Also ripped/teared ears etc.

<b id="interbreed">INTERBREEDING</b> <a href="#top">^ up ^</a><br>
The African Wildcat can breed with the Domestic Cat, European Wildcat(?), Serval(?)<br>
Interbreeding is possible as they are so closely related to domestic cats. Pure genetic African Wild Cats are quite rare and only found in remote areas as elsewhere interbreeding with domestic cats has taken place.
